      <h2>Reflections on My Concert Journey</h2>
    <p>
    I have been to several concerts throughout my lifetime. I have always been a huge fan of music in general and really fell in love with rock and metal at the age of 9.
    On my 9th birthday my father got me a guitar and I loved to learn new songs from bands like Linkin Park, Three Days Grace, or Disturbed when I eventually got good enough.
    Over the years I have seen so many artists in so many settings and this website is just scratching the surface of every one i've been too. This is basically just the ones
    that I have recorded since I was a teen, but I went to several before that even started. Above this paragraph I have a table showing the 25 shows that I have saved into my
    google drive. I have also done work in the Audio/Visual world with some of these artists and many others that aren't on this website.
